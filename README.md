## Welcome to My GitHub Portfolio

Here are the list of projects and labs I have completed over the course of my 2-year minor in Computer Information Technology (CIT) at the University of Oregon.

A majority of my coding experience is in JS, HTML, CSS, and Node.js; with growing experiences in front end development.

The labs and projects are organized by the course they were completed in, and courses are listed from most recent to oldest.
